# Text as data final project

# Members: Jorge Roa, Luke Smith, Augusto Fonseca, Alvaro Guijarro

Instructions: Your final assignment is a presentation of a group research project, of your own choosing. The only requirement is that the project involves the analysis of text and uses the methods that we cover in the course. Grading will be determined by the quality of the presentation, the degree to which you manage to apply the skills you have learned during the course, and the soundness and interest of your analysis.
